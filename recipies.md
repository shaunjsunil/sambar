 Then add 1 tablespoon cumin seeds and ¼ teaspoon fenugreek seeds.
 Next add 12 to 15 curry leaves and 2 tablespoons coriander seeds.
  Also add 3 to 4 dry Kashmiri red chilies and ¼ teaspoon asafoetida (hing).
Fry till they are light brown.
Now add about 1 to 1.5 cups of grated coconut.
Roast it with the rest of the spices till the coconut is golden and you get a fragrant aroma . Let this mixture cool.
Once, cooled, grind this roasted spice mixture in the grinder.
Add some water.
Blend till smooth.
Now the sambar masala paste is ready . Keep the paste aside and...

Rinse 1 cup of tuvar dal (arhar dal or pigeon pea lentils) 3 to 4 times in water.
Take tuvar dal in a pressure cooker. Add 1 small sized chopped onion and 1 to 2 pinches of asafoetida/hing.
Add 2.5 to 3 cups water.
Pressure cook for 3 to 4 whistles or till the dal is soft and well cooked.
Mash the cooked dal slightly with a spoon when done.
Add 10 to 12 shallots (sambar onions), 5 to 7 chopped brinjals and 1 large-sized chopped tomato. Add all the vegetables except for the okra to the cooked tuvar dal.
Add water as required.
Next add ½ teaspoon turmeric powder.
 Give a nice stir to the entire mixture.
 Cook the dal with the vegetables until they are half cooked. This takes about 11-12 minutes.
 Now add 8 to 10 chopped okra and ½ cup tamarind pulp. To make tamarind pulp, soak 1 lemon sized tamarind in ½ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes. Then squeeze the soaked tamarind with your fingers and add in the soaked water. Then use the tamarind pulp in the sambar.
  Add the sambar masala paste.
Mix and stir well. add some more water if the sambar has become thick.
Add salt as required.
Give the sambar a rolling boil once and then simmer till the veggies are cooked.
This will approximately take about 15-16 minutes. Close the flame when all the ingredients in the sambar have nicely infused with one another and you have a lovely sambar aroma pervading all around in your kitchen.
 Keep the sambar closed with a lid and move on to the next step of tempering the sambar.


 To prepare tempering for Kerala sambar


 Measure and keep all the ingredients ready for the tempering/tadka.
 In a pan or the tadka utensil, heat 2 tablespoons coconut oil. Add 1 teaspoon mustard seeds and let them pop.
 Then add 1 teaspoon urad dal, 2 to 3 dry red chilies and 1 sprig curry leaves. fry the red chilies till they change color. take care that the red chilies do not get burnt.
 Once the tadka is ready, directly pour the hot tadka on the hot sambar.
 Immediately, cover the Kerala sambar with a lid and let it stay closed for around 8 to 10 minutes. We do this at home so that the flavors and aroma of the tadka get very well infused with the sambar or dal.
 Later mix well.

 now the sambar is ready to be served,Enjoy.
